Just a simple daily logger using bash.

If the script doesn't work, then you probably need to redefine the hash bang at line one to path towards where your bash is located.

--> type ```which bash```

Also, you might want to change the location in which the daily_log.txt file is sent to. Just change the path of the daily_log variable.
